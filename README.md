React Gaming is a e-commerce store where alot the classic games you played growing up are being sold. Most of these games arent sold in stores anymore and many people dont know where to find these games, besides meeting up with strangers on facebook marketplace or other apps. Not only could it be dangerous to buy from a private seller but also risky. What if the game that you buy doesnt work? There is a high chance you wont see your money again. React Gaming sells you scratch free games that is tested before being sold. This store was built with React Js, Redux and redux toolkit. Redux handles the state management using actions, meaning all of the components will have access to a single page of truth which will be in our redux store. My redux store holds the entire aplication's state inside. Which allows the state to be updated/collected. Both redux and redux toolkit work good together. I had reducers for my products that manages the state and runs fuctions when state is updated. For example using the search bar, filtering products by category etc.. I used another reducceer for my cart. That would allow me to do things like add & remove items, increment the quantity and calculate the items that will give you the final price.
